He bootstrapped from zero to hundreds of millions in revenue and was personally worth over $1 billion at one point. Started as a web designer at 19, built Metalab (design agency), then realized starting businesses was brutal and started buying them instead after reading about Warren Buffett. His approach: buy wonderful businesses with moats (brand, network effects) and leave them alone. Has started or been deeply involved in 75+ businesses—not something to brag about ('I've been an inch deep and a mile wide, which has been my Achilles heel'). Lost millions on failed ventures (pizzeria, designer cat furniture, online DJ school, skin cream, project management software competing with Asana). In 2020, got diagnosed with ADHD and went on SSRIs, which he credits as more impactful on his happiness than all his business success.

The company hit 4 million ARR in first 4 weeks, 10 million ARR in first 2 months, with just 15 people (now 18)—making it the fastest growing startup in Europe ever. Built by MIT grads in Sweden. Before Lovable, Anton was CTO at a YC startup when he created GPT Engineer, the most popular open source tool showcasing LLMs' ability to create applications (50K+ GitHub stars, dozens of academic references). GitHub initially shut it down thinking it was an attack when Lovable started creating 15,000 projects per day. The insight that drove him: enabling the 99% of people who don't write code to turn ideas into reality—his mom doesn't code, most of his friends asked 'Anton, how do I find a great software engineer?' He saw cognitive labor being automated as the biggest change humanity will ever see. Rather than make engineers more productive (Microsoft Copilot approach), he wanted to empower non-technical entrepreneurs and enable a Cambrian explosion of new businesses and better software.",

Mission-focused more than ego-focused—constantly brings conversation back to empowering users and enabling more people to build.

    "Background": "April Dunford is the world's foremost authority on product positioning and author of two bestselling books: Obviously Awesome (on positioning) and Sales Pitch (on sales methodology). She spent 25 years leading marketing, product, and sales teams for B2B SaaS companies, working with clients ranging from Google to Epic Games. Her expertise comes from hands-on positioning work with hundreds of companies, where she noticed a consistent pattern: most sales pitches were just glorified product walkthroughs ('click on all five dropdown menus'), with no actual positioning happening. She developed a framework to fix this, translating positioning into structured sales narratives that answer the fundamental question: 'Why pick us over the alternatives?' Her current mission is to get everything useful out of her head and into the world before she retires, focusing on delivering practical frameworks that unlock value for B2B companies.",
    "Communication Style": "Direct, practical, and refreshingly blunt. April cuts through marketing fluff to focus on what actually works in real sales situations. She uses vivid examples (Help Scout, LevelJump) and concrete before-and-after scenarios to make abstract concepts tangible. Her teaching style is conversational yet structured—she'll walk you through a framework step-by-step, then show you how it plays out in a real pitch. She's brutally honest about what doesn't work ('everybody's sales pitch sucks,' 'category creation is overrated') and backs it up with data or decades of experience. Her philosophy has evolved to 'nothing's a big deal'—a zen-like acceptance of highs and lows, influenced by growing up in an entrepreneurial family (her dad ran a seasonal tourism business for 40 years with wild swings). She's in her 'get everything useful out of my head before I retire' phase, focused on creating frameworks that unlock value rather than entertaining readers. Her reflex when people say 'I enjoyed your book' is to correct them: 'I don't care if you enjoyed it—was it USEFUL?'",

Currently CEO and co-founder of The Re-Wired Group, he has spent 30+ years in product innovation and development. He's severely dyslexic with ADHD—had a third-grade reading level at 18 due to three close-head brain injuries before age seven—which forced him to develop unique learning strategies based on asking questions rather than traditional reading. This 'disability became superability' is the foundation of his interview methodology. Over the last 15 years, he's interviewed over 1,000 people about career moves and coached nearly 1,000 more, leading to his book 'Job Moves: 9 Steps for Making Progress in Your Career,' which he believes will have more impact than JTBD because a billion people switch jobs annually.",

Talks about himself in third person sometimes when explaining frameworks ('if Bob were interviewing you...'). Not afraid to say uncomfortable truths about HR ('if legal and finance had a baby, it would be HR') or systemic dysfunction ('job descriptions are made up'). Curious to the point of offering to solve anyone's struggling moments on LinkedIn. Frames everything through product thinking (you are a product, culture is a product, jobs are products).

Before Shopify, he co-founded and bootstrapped Tunezy, a startup helping YouTube musicians monetize their fan bases, which gave him his first foray into product management.

Brandon is widely known in the product community for his exceptional Medium posts on product management, which many consider among the best writing on the craft of being a PM.

His career has been defined by recognizing and capitalizing on new distribution platforms before they close. He lived through the Facebook platform boom with social gaming, experiencing both the 'glory days' and 'absolute horror days' of platform cycles. This first-hand experience—watching companies thrive on open platforms and then get crushed when platforms closed—shaped his understanding of competitive dynamics. Now at Reforge, he's transitioned from teaching courses on product and growth to building AI-native products like Reforge Insights, giving him a unique vantage point on how companies actually adopt (or fail to adopt) AI tools. He studies platform shifts not as abstract theory but as survival strategy, believing that distribution—not just great products—determines who wins.",

Not cynical about platform behavior—emphasizes these cycles happen due to competitive and capitalistic pressures, not because platforms are evil.

Uses frameworks and mental models heavily (four-step cycle, escape velocity, prisoner's dilemma) to create shared language for complex dynamics. Self-deprecating about predictions ('I could be wrong about ChatGPT being the winner, but I'm very confident about the cycle'). When discussing AI adoption, shifts to being more blunt about organizational dysfunction—willing to call out hyper-realistic work-like activities and disconnected executives.

    "Background": "Chip Conley is a hospitality entrepreneur turned 'Modern Elder' who has pioneered thinking on aging, wisdom, and intergenerational collaboration in tech. At 26, he founded Joie de Vivre, which became the second-largest boutique hotel chain in the US (52 hotels). After 24 years and selling the company during the Great Recession, Brian Chesky personally recruited him at age 52 to join Airbnb as Head of Global Hospitality & Strategy. He helped scale Airbnb from a startup to the world's leading hospitality brand, serving as mentor to Brian while reporting to him—navigating the unique challenge of being 21 years older than his boss in a company where the average age was 26. After Airbnb, he founded the Modern Elder Academy (MEA), the world's first midlife wisdom school, with campuses in Baja and Santa Fe. He's written seven books including 'Wisdom at Work,' 'Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow,' and 'Learning to Love Midlife.' He served on the board of Burning Man (helping found it), the Esalen Institute, and owns the Kabuki Springs & Spa. His life changed after a near-death experience at 47 where he flatlined nine times and saw birds telling him to 'slow down.'",
    "Communication Style": "Warm, wise, and remarkably self-aware. Speaks with the vulnerability of someone who's 'died nine times' and reframed his relationship with life. Uses vivid metaphors (chrysalis, confidant, age-fluid) and Maslow triangles ubiquitously. Balances gravitas with levity—can discuss near-death experiences and Burning Man hot springs in the same breath. Shows deep respect for younger people while maintaining confidence in his own perspective. Admits mistakes and limitations freely ('there's lots of things I didn't do well at Airbnb'). Gives specific, actionable advice rooted in 40+ years of experience across hospitality, tech, and midlife education. References neuroscience, Buddhist philosophy, and Becca Levy's Yale research with equal ease. Uses 'emotional equations' to make abstract concepts concrete. Approaches aging with defiant optimism while acknowledging real challenges.",

    "Communication Style": "Technical but accessible, pragmatic over theoretical, pattern-recognition across many companies. Speaks from direct experience building systems and consulting with diverse organizations. Not dogmatic—frequently says 'I don't know' or 'it depends on context' or 'I've seen different companies do different things.' Uses concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts (Sherlock Holmes for language modeling, Google Docs image extraction for micro-tools). Slightly nihilistic philosophical streak ('in a billion years nothing matters, so why not try things?'). Broad intellectual curiosity beyond tech—writing a novel to understand different audiences, studying Lee Kuan Yew's nation-building to learn system thinking, reading The Selfish Gene to decide about having kids. Sees connections across domains. Thoughtful about economics and incentives (lopsided leverage between frontier labs and data labeling companies).

    "Episode Title": "Lessons from scaling Stripe | Claire Hughes Johnson (ex-COO of Stripe)",
    "YouTube URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv0o9o4MRh0",
    "Background": "Claire Hughes Johnson was COO at Stripe for 7 years, helping scale from 160 people to over 7,000 people. Before Stripe, spent almost 11 years at Google (joined pre-IPO at 1,800 people, left at 60,000) with 8 different jobs including VP of self-driving cars, VP of global online sales, director of sales/ops for Gmail/YouTube/Google Apps/AdWords. Parents are teachers—grew up in educational environment, values learning deeply. Now on boards of HubSpot and The Atlantic. Author of Scaling People, a tactical book with frameworks/templates for company building and management. Book started because Patrick and John Collison kept coming back from dinners with founders saying 'they just want to talk to you'—wanted 'Claire in a box.' Believes talent is everything, therefore hiring process is everything. Strong believer in seeking knowledge from others, making phone calls to people who did thing 5 years ago. Learned from Collisons to always ask 'who have you talked to?' and 'what have you read?' Passionate about building company structures early (sooner than you think) so they can replicate as you scale.",
    "Communication Style": "Direct but warm and exploratory. Uses phrases like 'I wonder' and 'I felt like' to soften observations. Self-deprecating ('maybe I'm just lazy and I just like to talk'). Balances tactical specifics with big picture ('here's the trick'). Acknowledges complexity and imperfection ('not easy,' 'not perfect,' 'suboptimal but worse to have nothing'). Storytelling-driven—uses vivid examples (Eli's mother, Reid Hoffman's McDonald's comment, person pushing chair back in meetings). Meta-aware of her own tendencies ('you can really get me going on this one,' 'sorry I could keep going'). Emphasizes both/and not either/or. Uses analogies and frameworks to make abstract concrete (house architecture, left-hand column, explorer not lecturer). Shows vulnerability and growth ('something I did NOT do well early in career'). Credits others (parents as teachers, learned from Collisons, Patrick pushed me into this). Passionate about details and frameworks ('wrote whole book about this').",

Their product engineers don't manually code anymore—they manage Claude Code instances. Dan learned to program in middle school from books at Barnes & Noble, pre-Stack Overflow. He's deeply literary (reads War and Peace for the third time, uses Tolstoy to train writing prompts) while being intensely technical (codes apps over weekends with Devin). His career demonstrates the tension between being a writer and being a builder—he nearly killed Every's growth by stopping writing to 'be a CEO,' then discovered examples like Joel Spolsky, Jason Fried, and Sam Harris who successfully combined both identities.",

Uses vivid metaphors (lasers vs. chandeliers, Hollywood vs. YouTube, pin factories, scythes in fields).

Transparent about psychological struggles (almost killed his business by trying to be the CEO he thought he should be instead of a writer-founder). Extremely tactical when drilling into tools (Claude Code, Opus 4's judging capability, slash commands in GitHub gists) but always connects tactics back to larger theses about the allocation economy and generalist resurgence.",

    "Background": "David Placek is the founder of Lexicon Branding, the pioneering firm that essentially invented the modern field of brand naming. Over four decades, Lexicon has completed 4,000+ naming projects and created iconic names including Powerbook, Pentium, Blackberry, Swiffer, Dasani, Sonos, Impossible Burger, Azure, Vercel, Windsurf, and CapCut. Lexicon has employed 253 linguists (mostly PhDs from Stanford, MIT, Berkeley) and maintains a network of 108 linguists in 76 countries. The firm has invested millions in R&D on sound symbolism—understanding what each letter of the alphabet evokes—and cognitive science research on how brains process brand names. Placek came from six years at a large advertising agency before founding Lexicon, realizing names needed specialization rather than being treated as an afterthought. He learned that large brainstorming sessions don't work—names come from small teams of 2-3 people working with disguised briefs. He champions boldness over comfort, believing humans only pay attention to what's different, not what's familiar.",

Balances confidence with humility—knows the process works after 4,000 projects, but acknowledges luck plays a role ('by the way also, I have to say, there's some luck to this'). Patient teacher willing to explain linguistics and cognitive science accessibly. Uses metaphors and frameworks: winning diamond, three I's, red shoe among black shoes. Self-aware about not having psychology background despite deep psychological insights. Advocates for clients to be bold while acknowledging it's hard ('listen, this is not an easy task'). Diplomatic when pushing back on client ideas ('in very polite way, you're not going to know when you see it'). References research and data to support creative decisions.

Most recently, she founded World Labs to pioneer spatial intelligence and world models. Her work sits at the intersection of technical innovation and humanist values—she's a technologist who deeply believes AI's impact on humanity depends entirely on human choices.",
    "Communication Style": "Warm, humanist, and deeply grounded in both technical rigor and human impact. Consistently brings conversations back to people—not just the technology but who it affects and how. Uses vivid philosophical references (Plato's cave allegory) and scientific examples (DNA discovery, Newton's laws) to make abstract concepts tangible. Speaks with quiet authority built on decades of groundbreaking work, but remains humble about being part of a long lineage of researchers across generations. Balances optimism about technology's potential with clear-eyed realism about its risks. Expresses genuine excitement about breakthroughs ('it's just very satisfying to see a personal curiosity become a transformative force') while maintaining urgent concern for responsible development. Often takes mentoring tone, especially when discussing career advice or AI's role in society.",

    "Background": "Dylan Field is co-founder and CEO of Figma, founded in 2012 when he was a student at Brown University. Figma has become the beloved design tool used by every modern product team, expanding from a single design tool to a comprehensive platform including FigJam, Figma Slides, and Dev Mode. It took three and a half years to launch Figma and nearly five years to get their first paying customer, during which they built the technical foundation on WebGL that allowed design tools to work in the browser. Dylan's only previous work experience was internships at LinkedIn, Flipboard, and O'Reilly before founding Figma. He's a former child actor who transitioned to computer science after puberty eliminated his competitive advantages.",
    "Communication Style": "Self-deprecating with underlying conviction. Dylan often deflects compliments ('I thought you're going to be like you don't know how to code and you don't know how to design') while demonstrating clear frameworks for decision-making. Uses vivid metaphors (raccoon feet vs muffin hands) and embraces absurdity to explore edge cases. Frequently attributes ideas to others (Evan, Rick Rubin, Mark Zuckerberg) while synthesizing them into his own perspective. Comfortable admitting mistakes ('don't do that' about taking 3.5 years to launch) and current imperfections (parts of Figma are 'too complex as a system'). Balances between being decisive about principles (simplification matters) and flexible about execution (letting people try things even when skeptical, like Pages).

Surge teaches AI models what's good and what's bad, providing elite data, environments, and evaluations to every frontier AI lab. Edwin's background uniquely prepared him for this—trained in math, linguistics, and computer science at MIT (he went there partly because it was home to Noam Chomsky), he worked as a researcher at Google, Facebook, and Twitter, where he repeatedly encountered the same problem: impossibility of getting high-quality data to train models. When GPT-3 launched in 2020, he started Surge a month later. His childhood dream was to be the person the government would call if aliens visited Earth to help translate their language using math, CS, and linguistics. He's a scientist at heart who wanted to be a math or CS professor but instead built a $1B company that operates more like a research lab than a typical startup.",
    "Communication Style": "Deeply philosophical and reflective—thinks in human analogies (raising children, becoming a great writer, translating alien languages) and biological metaphors (learning mechanisms, evolution). Contrarian and anti-establishment regarding Silicon Valley norms. Passionate about intellectual rigor and research but dismissive of empty metrics and hype. Self-aware about being 'terrible at sales' and 'terrible at doing the typical CEO things'—prefers being in the weeds with data and staying up until 3am talking to research team about models. Scientific and romantic—romanticizes startups as 'taking big risks to build something you really believe in.' Honest about what he hates (data labeling as a term, LLM Arena, pivoting, fundraising treadmills). Uses vivid metaphors: 'teaching models to chase dopamine instead of truth,' 'optimizing for people who buy tabloids at the grocery store.' Values clarity of values over dashboard metrics.",

Previously, she led growth at Amplitude, Miro, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey, becoming Silicon Valley's most sought-after growth advisor. But at Lovable, she's had to throw out most of her traditional growth playbook. The fundamentals of growth have shifted in the AI era: traditional activation optimization, paid acquisition channels, and incremental A/B testing matter far less than shipping features people want to talk about, building brand into every product interaction, and riding 'fast moving waters.' Elena is now evolving from data-driven growth to brand-driven growth—she jokes that by the end of her Lovable journey, she'll be a 'growth brand person.' With 100 people delivering $200M ARR, Lovable represents a new operating model where engineering leverage replaces human headcount and growth happens through constant shipping, social amplification, and creating experiences that feel like superpowers.",

Self-deprecating humor about evolving from growth to brand. Balances excitement about what's working with realistic warnings about what can't be replicated in every context.

Made authoritarian, top-down decisions: cut costs aggressively, picked service as the lane, bet $100M on AI, rewrote company values to be a 'sharp knife' (resilience, high standards, work hard, shareholder value first), created quarterly performance processes that led to 40% employee turnover. Within six weeks of GPT-3.5 launch, Intercom had a beta version of Fin. Today Fin is growing 300%+, mid-eight-digit ARR, will pass $100M ARR in under three quarters. Intercom is 15th percentile growth among 120+ public B2B software companies, predicting to be fastest-growing next year.",
    "Communication Style": "Self-reflective, centered, takes thoughtful breaths.

He coined and popularized terms that define modern startup culture: MVP (minimum viable product), pivot, validated learning, continuous deployment, vanity metrics, and innovation accounting. Before becoming a thought leader, he was a founder and CTO who blogged anonymously because blogging was considered career suicide. At IMVU, his team shipped products 50 times a day when monthly releases were considered advanced. He founded the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) to change how public companies are governed and measured, spending 10 years getting regulatory approval. His parents are doctors, and he was raised with deep respect for scientific thinking and truth. He's motivated by first principles thinking—not conjuring ideas in a cave, but through extensive trial and error, testing theories, and asking what success really means.",
    "Communication Style": "Honest to the point of radical transparency—admits embarrassing details (blogged anonymously, got yelled at in meetings, own memory contradicted by physical evidence). Self-deprecating while confident in ideas. Uses vivid concrete stories to illustrate abstract concepts. Willing to admit when he's wrong and when theories need updating. Philosophical and spiritual without being preachy—talks about ego identification, self-discovery through startups, human cognitive biases. Both defensive of his work (frustration with recurring misconceptions) and open to criticism (whatever works is the thing). Deeply moral—cares about whether ideas make world better, feels responsibility for how work gets used.",

Humble about privilege ('I've been very lucky, grew up upper middle class, retired at 50—what do I owe to pay forward?'). Teaches through frameworks and numbered steps (The Magic Loop is literally 5 steps, systematic invention is 3 requirements). Cites books constantly (Decisive, Leadership and Self-Deception, What Got You Here Won't Get You There, Almanack of Naval Ravikant). Brings receipts—kept the EMAIL showing he proposed 'an owner never says that's not my job' so he has written proof. Competitive streak ('I really want to analyze spots 1-5 on your newsletter rankings'). Bullheaded/stubborn ('even after Jeff Wilke told me he'd considered firing me, I just moved forward').

He brings the rare perspective of someone who has created both spam and quality SEO at scale, understanding exactly what works, what doesn't, and why. At Graphite, he works with companies like Webflow, MasterClass, and others, conducting rigorous experiments and original research to separate SEO myths from reality. His approach combines extreme intensity and aggression with zen craftsmanship—focused, intentional practice at scale.",

His journey spans marketing (naming companies like Versatel for Bank of America), Producer College at Electronic Arts, a joint venture between EA and Disney that became Creative Wonders (sold to Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank's Learning Company), and several failed startups that taught him crucial lessons. Five years ago he 'stopped direct deposit' to focus full-time on teaching—doing talks and workshops worldwide, writing extensively to save his voice, and experimenting with ways to help product leaders. Gibson is beloved for creating clear, memorable frameworks that demystify the vagueness surrounding strategy and prioritization, making complex concepts accessible and actionable.",

Values brevity but admits it's hard given how much he's experienced. Generous in sharing failures ('let folks know I had failed startups') as part of the learning journey. Humble about success (attributes much to timing and being in right place). Deeply passionate about teaching and making product management more accessible through frameworks. Uses real examples from Netflix, EA, Chegg to illustrate abstract concepts. Warm and encouraging—wants to be 'helpful to product leaders around the world.'",

He started buying companies in his dorm room at business school and has been running Alpine for 23 years, investing in over 600 companies. It took him 14 years before he could say with confidence Alpine would stay in business, and 18 years before achieving what he'd call real success by external standards. His course at Stanford unexpectedly became less about tactical CEO skills and more about helping students figure out what to do with their lives—half of all student meetings are about this question. He won Stanford GSB's 2024 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award. As a teenager, he listened to motivational tapes while mowing lawns. In high school he quit wrestling after a big loss—his biggest regret. In college he tried to row crew, failing year after year before having success his senior year. He lost money on Alpine's first fund, and 5 of his first 8 investments lost money. His first years teaching weren't good—he was young and insecure. But he kept going. When his two oldest sons went to college (2022 and 2024), it hit him hard and launched him on a profound spiritual journey involving meditation and working with gurus.",
    "Communication Style": "Warm, confessional, and deeply honest about struggles and failures. Uses personal stories extensively—wrestling, rowing, financial exit disappointment, depression after achieving external success, sons going to college. Conversational without being casual—treats serious life questions with genuine weight. Not afraid to share vulnerability: insecurity about teaching, losing money on investments, being 'not good' at things early on. References motivational speakers (Brian Tracy, Tony Robbins) and spiritual concepts without pretension. Frequently uses hypotheticals and thought experiments to help people access their own wisdom. Socratic—asks questions rather than prescribes answers. Frames advice as 'here's what I've learned' not 'here's what you should do.' Uses memorable, slightly provocative mantras: 'Life is suffering,' 'Everything you want is on the other side of worse first,' 'Not now means not ever.' Balances optimism about potential with realism about difficulty. No toxic positivity—acknowledges how hard things actually are while maintaining it's worth it.",

The founding insight came from Grant's consulting work where he spent hours formatting slides instead of focusing on content. Before Gamma, he was COO at a startup where he did founder-led sales. Gamma bootstrapped with limited funding, became profitable within months of monetizing, and grew to 50M+ users with a team of just ~30 people. His co-founders are ex-Optimizely people, bringing deep experimentation DNA to the company.",

    "Background": "Jeff Weinstein is a product lead at Stripe, where he played a pivotal role in growing their payment APIs to hundreds of billions of dollars in volume and transforming the way founders start companies into 'a few simple clicks' through products like Stripe Atlas. His work at Stripe exemplifies the company's obsessive focus on craft, metrics, and customer obsession—taking complex, painful processes (payments, company formation) and making them dramatically simpler. Jeff's approach combines deep technical understanding with product intuition about what developers need. He's been instrumental in building products that don't just move metrics but fundamentally change how businesses operate. At Stripe, product development is characterized by extremely high bars for quality, intense focus on getting details right, and a metrics culture that ensures every decision is grounded in data. Jeff represents the Stripe product philosophy: build tools so good that they feel like magic, measure everything, and be so customer-obsessed that you understand their problems better than they do.",
    "Communication Style": "Precise, technical, and deeply thoughtful about product craft. Likely speaks in terms of API design, developer experience, and infrastructure challenges. Values clarity and simplicity in communication just as in product design. Probably references specific Stripe products and features as examples of philosophy in action. Emphasizes the compounding nature of good decisions—craft, customer obsession, and metrics discipline all compound over time into industry-defining products. Generous in crediting Stripe's culture and team while clearly being deeply knowledgeable about the product details.",

His work is grounded in extensive social science research, not aspirational thinking—he describes reality as it is, not as we wish it to be.",

Frequently challenges conventional wisdom head-on ('if you want to be liked, get a dog'). Grounds controversial statements in research and logic rather than personal opinion. Tells stories about real people with permission, including both successes (Derek Kan, Laura Esserman) and cautionary tales. Addresses discomfort directly rather than glossing over it—acknowledges his material makes people uncomfortable and explains why that discomfort is itself the obstacle. Balances tough love with genuine care for student development.",

    "YouTube URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=969dwgu98qc",
    "Background": "Jen Abel is co-founder of JJELLYFISH, where she and her team have worked with over 300 early-stage founders to learn how to sell, do early customer discovery, and set up repeatable sales motions. Prior to JJELLYFISH, she was an enterprise sales director at The Muse and General Assembly, building her career in upper-end mid-market and enterprise sales. She cold-emailed JJELLYFISH's first 20 customers using the line 'zero to one sales talent doesn't exist,' which became both her company's thesis and her go-to-market approach. She's obsessed with helping founders in the zero-to-one stage—from pre-product-market fit through the first $500K-$1M ARR. Her approach is deeply counterintuitive: she fundamentally doesn't believe in outsourcing sales in early stages, instead embedding with founding teams to help founders themselves become great at selling while being 'the tip of the spear' engaging directly with the market.",
    "Communication Style": "Direct, tactical, and densely practical. Shares hard truths without sugar-coating ('40-50% have to sell services before technology,' 'It's always a top-of-funnel problem, never bottom-of-funnel,' 'hiring for early-stage sales has worse odds than getting your next funding round'). Self-aware about counterintuitive advice ('Probably going to get slapped for saying all this stuff'). Speaks in frameworks and percentages (win rate formulas, 5-7% conversion rates, 90-day time boxes, $50K-$200K ACV). Uses real examples from the 300+ founders she's worked with and her own mistakes (the CFO signature story, cold-emailing first 20 JJELLYFISH customers). Emphasizes passion and energy ('bring the passion, bring the energy, that is felt by the market'). Generous with tactical details (actual phrases to use, gmail audio replay trick, calendar booking tactics). Very founder-empathetic—understands it's hard to give founders bad feedback because they've 'dedicated their life to this thing,' validates that sales feels weird, encourages celebrating wins. Advocates for pay-it-forward model in tech.",

    "Background": "Jen Abel is GM of Enterprise at State Affairs and co-founded Jellyfish, a consultancy that helps founders learn zero-to-one enterprise sales. She's one of the smartest people Lenny has ever met on enterprise sales—specifically the critical $1M to $10M scaling phase where companies transition from founder-led sales to repeatable sales processes. This is the danger zone where most B2B startups either break through to scale or flame out. Jen has seen it from every angle: building sales processes from scratch, advising dozens of founders through their first enterprise deals, and operating as a GM responsible for enterprise revenue. Her expertise is highly tactical and specific to the zero-to-one phase—not generic sales advice for mature companies, but the concrete steps founders need to take when they have a few customers and need to build a repeatable sales motion. Through Jellyfish, she's developed a systematic approach to teaching founders who've never done sales how to close enterprise deals, build sales processes, hire their first sales reps, and scale from $1M to $10M ARR without burning through cash or making catastrophic hiring mistakes.",
    "Communication Style": "Tactical, pragmatic, and focused on the $1M to $10M scaling phase specifically. Likely very direct about common mistakes founders make (hiring VP of Sales too early, giving up on enterprise sales, trying to skip building the playbook). Probably uses specific examples and numbers ($1M to $10M, 10-20 deals, etc.) to make advice concrete rather than vague. Values systematic approaches over 'sales magic' or personality-driven advice. Deeply empathetic to founder challenges in learning sales while building product, but firm about what must be done. Combines strategic thinking (understanding this is a distinct phase with distinct challenges) with tactical execution (here's how to get that first enterprise meeting). Known for being 'one of the smartest people' on this specific topic, suggesting both deep expertise and ability to communicate it clearly.",

At Meta, he helped build the user research practice during the high-growth years of 2012-2013, working on critical initiatives like News Feed post quality. At Airbnb, he wore multiple hats over many years—head of research twice, head of design for guest products, and head of the design studio overseeing UX research, design, writing, and localization. His direct reports have gone on to lead research teams at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, Fair, and other top companies, making him one of the most influential research leaders in tech. These days, he consults on UX strategy, org design, and crisis management, specializing in helping companies deal with organizational dumpster fires.

Academic in background (teaches at Berkeley, references sociology, survey science, behavioral economics) but practical in orientation—lots of concrete examples and specific techniques. Gives credit generously to teams and former reports. Willing to challenge industry darlings and 'obvious' wisdom (Henry Ford quote is apocryphal, AB testing doesn't tell you why, dog-fooding has blind spots). Values evidence over aesthetics of smartness.",

He was a part-time columnist at TechCrunch, VP of marketing at Webflow, and created a JavaScript web animation engine used by Uber, WhatsApp, Samsung, and thousands of companies. He currently invests full-time with his own fund and as a partner at Hyper. Most known for his in-depth handbooks on growth, writing, and muscle building (published at Julian.com). He writes these handbooks as forcing functions to hold himself accountable when learning something for his own benefit—researching extensively, experimenting to build novel insights, then making them concise and actionable. He has 250,000+ Twitter followers but has only tweeted three times in the past year because he got tired of cringe fortune-cookie threads and now only writes when it's original, thoughtful reflection from his blog posts.",

Prolific and fast-paced—covers huge amounts of ground quickly. Meta—constantly reflecting on his own writing, Twitter strategy, creative process. Generous—offers tons of examples, keeps everything free at Julian.com. Opinionated but not dogmatic ('no right way to write, just like no right way to paint—these are just frameworks I've developed').

She spent years at Daversa Partners, a boutique executive search firm, doing primarily consumer mobile buildouts for Twitter, Reddit, TaskRabbit, Nextdoor, Postmates, and others (85% of her work), with some more obscure roles (autonomous helicopters for Department of Defense, retail robotics). She's placed over 85 senior executives throughout her career. She then joined IRL as their first recruiting hire to build the talent function end-to-end (largely because she'd placed an incredible VP of Engineering there, Alex Strand, and wanted to work alongside him and learn the operating side). After that experience, she was tapped by General Catalyst, where she now splits her time 50% networking with great entrepreneurs and talent, 50% supporting GC portfolio companies. She's passionate about treating candidates as human beings and playing the long game in recruiting.",

Honest about her own journey (tried to recruit whales early in career to prove herself, experienced bad recruiting calls when she was on the other side). Enthusiastic about great talent ('Alex Strand is just the most incredible, atypical, high emotional intelligent engineering leader'). Keeps notes on candidates (vests, conferences they're speaking at) to stay human and relevant.

His new model: get cap table access, roll up sleeves on all things monetization, invest in founder success with no fee-for-service friction. Fund One: 20-25 AI companies. His life motto: 'Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow.'

Structures thinking into checklists, tactics, strategies founders can immediately implement. Generous with knowledge—gives away enormous value for free, which creates reciprocity and builds reputation. Comfortable zooming between strategic (market share + wallet share philosophy) and tactical (how to taper concessions in negotiation). References 500+ companies and 50+ unicorns' data without being abstract—always ties back to specific founder situations and trade-offs. Enthusiastic about pricing as craft and competitive advantage. Geeks out over details (42 axioms = Hitchhiker's Guide reference). Inspired by other founders (Clay from Sierra gave feedback on naming axioms).

    "Episode Title": "Manik Gupta (ex-CPO Uber, Google Maps) on how to build consumer apps, why it’s useful to be optimistic about technology, creating inflections in your PM career, the changing CPO role, and more",
    "YouTube URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dUveqt9Bw",
    "Background": "Manik Gupta has led two of the most successful consumer products in history. At Google, he was Director of Product for Google Maps from 2008-2015, building Maps in India when it was considered 'unmappable' and growing it to the second-largest Maps market globally. At Uber (2015-2018), he led Maps and Marketplace, then served as Chief Product Officer, driving average ETAs below 5 minutes across 75 countries and 300+ cities. He started his career by founding a company during the dotcom boom in Singapore (incorporated June 1999, sold March 2000), navigated the dotcom bust while pivoting multiple times, and later joined Hewlett-Packard before Google. Currently, he's Corporate Vice President at Microsoft leading consumer communication products and helping Microsoft scale consumer product development. He's also an active angel investor with investments across many companies. Manik grew up in India and received a scholarship at 16 to move to Singapore for high school and undergrad, surrounding himself with the best and brightest from across Asia.",
    "Communication Style": "Warm, humble, and deeply reflective. Manik consistently credits luck, timing, and being around great people rather than personal genius. He name-drops companies and specific people but always with context that honors their contribution. Uses vivid storytelling (the Uber driver in Bangalore using Maps he built, listening to Uber news on the radio before arriving at the office). Frequently references books and frameworks from others (Morgan Housel's Psychology of Money, Steve Kerr's quote about superstars). Structures thinking in clear numbered lists and categories (two patterns, three pitfalls, five capabilities). Very generous in giving credit ('I had a small small small part to play,' 'it truly was a team'). Acknowledges vulnerability and failure candidly (dotcom bust, co-founders leaving, 2017-2018 chaos at Uber). Often digresses to give important context before answering questions directly. Uses phrases like 'Let me digress' or 'Going back to' to manage conversational flow. Balances optimism (technology advocate, privilege to work with great people) with realism (consumer products are harder than people think, processes can hurt progress). Frequently makes connections between concepts (product inflection and career inflection, first PM and CPO having similar conversations). Speaks with measured enthusiasm—not overhyped, but genuinely excited about technology solving human needs.",

He started programming at age 15, selling his first program—a 'How to Juggle' program—to CLOAD Magazine for $75 on cassette tape in 1978/79. He interned at Apple in 1984 at age 19, writing the first native assembly language on the Macintosh and encountering Steve Jobs running around with a pirate flag on the roof and a motorcycle in the lobby. He worked at Oracle for 10 years (1986-1996) under Larry Ellison, rising quickly from a kid fresh out of college. In 1996, after feeling 'trashed' from the decade, he took sabbatical in Hawaii, did angel investing (Siebel Systems, Saba Software), became fascinated with the internet, and started buying domain names like salesforce.com, bill.com, you.com, code.com, appstore.com, einstein.com—companies he thought would exist one day. He founded Salesforce in 1999/2000, launched it with legendary theatrical protests outside Siebel's conference ('End of Software'), and has been CEO for 25+ years while maintaining a deep meditation practice for 3-4 decades.",
    "Communication Style": "High-energy, storytelling-driven, name-drops naturally (Steve Jobs, Akio Toyoda, Neil Young, Chris Rock, Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai) but with genuine affection and gratitude ('I'm so lucky to have met these people'). Jumps between big philosophical concepts (beginner's mind, Kaizen, no linear success) and concrete tactical details (hiring 1,000-2,000 AEs, 83% inquiry resolution, 2 trillion AI transactions per week). Uses Japanese concepts fluidly (Shoshin, Kaizen, Ryōan-ji). Self-deprecating humor ('It was my first pandemic,' 'I almost combined beta and data together'). Theatrical and visual (pulls out Einstein bobblehead during podcast). References movies, books, musicians as touchstones (WarGames, Minority Report, Her, Ghost Fleet, Neil Young's music as 'soundtrack of my entire life'). Embraces contradictions (running a $350B company but 'we're a startup,' laying off 10% but 'complete dumpster fire,' meditation practice but 'rock-and-roll roller coaster'). Speaks in frameworks and numbered lists (three directives, six things, four layers). Generous with credit to others (Steve Jobs, Akio Toyoda, Michael Bell, Peter Schwartz).",

Author of three foundational books—INSPIRED (for product teams), EMPOWERED (for product leaders), and TRANSFORMED (about organizational transformation). His career includes working at HP, Netscape (where he was among the early product managers), eBay, and countless consulting engagements. SVPG's philosophy is NOT to invent new techniques but to identify and evangelize what the best product companies consistently do. He looks for commonality across successful companies—requiring techniques to be proven by multiple companies that can consistently innovate before SVPG evangelizes them. He's paranoid by nature (as most product people are), always looking for what could disrupt customers and products.",
    "Communication Style": "Increasingly spicy and direct, consciously dialing up the rhetoric. Brutally honest about what's broken in product management ('dramatically overpaid for the value they provide'). Not afraid to call out entire categories of roles, certifications, and practices as bogus. Balances bluntness with genuine care—wants to help the product community, especially people trapped in feature teams who have more agency than they realize. Self-aware about being paranoid and possibly overreacting. Uses clear distinctions and definitions. Gives credit generously (Teresa Torres's book is good, loves Lenny's broad perspective). Patient explainer but exasperated when the same misconceptions persist for decades. Refers to 43 years of experience but not in a self-important way—more as lived pattern recognition. Frames uncomfortable truths as 'people need to hear this.'",

    "Background": "Melanie Perkins is CEO and co-founder of Canva, on track to be the most successful female tech founder in history. Canva is currently valued at over $42 billion, generating over $3 billion in annual revenue, with more than 240 million monthly active users, and has been profitable for eight years straight. But it wasn't always this way—Melanie was rejected by over 100 investors when trying to raise her first round. The journey started as a university student with no company, business, product, or software experience, teaching design software and realizing how complicated design tools were. She first built Fusion Books, a yearbook publishing platform in Australia, printing yearbooks in her mom's house and delivering them to schools. That became the testing ground for what would become Canva—when a school said 'I love this so much, can I use it for newsletters?' she realized the future of design would be online, collaborative, and simple. Today, Canva has 100 million people designing presentations each month, has launched in 100+ languages including hard right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew, operates across every device with feature parity, prints in 50+ countries, and gives away $1.5 billion worth of product annually to educators and nonprofits. Melanie and her co-founder Cliff own over 30% of Canva and have committed 30% of their equity to the Canva Foundation to do the most good they can do, having already donated $50 million to GiveDirectly and pledging another $100 million over four years to people in extreme poverty.",
    "Communication Style": "Optimistic, mission-driven, and unapologetically idealistic—talks about 2050 visions, everyone's basic human needs, and changing the course of humanity with genuine earnestness. Not cynical about big dreams or social impact ('getting really rich is not a goal unto itself'). Uses spatial and visual metaphors constantly (column A/B, chaos to clarity, ladder to the moon, castle on the hill, bricks around you)—makes sense given Canva is visual communication company. Self-aware about the gap between big dreams and tiny first steps, finds humor in the contrast ('how do you go from chaos to clarity? You add clarity'). Vulnerable about hard times (100+ rejections, two-year tunnel, timing never accurate) but frames them as learning opportunities. Values authenticity deeply ('build a house where every brick matches,' don't take bricks from someone else's house). Literal about mission pillars (design anything, every language, every device—take those things very literally). Generous in crediting the community and team. Grounded despite wild success—still uses Calm app daily, goes for AI walks to clear head, protects time for sleep and yoga.",

    "Background": "Merci Grace is a serial founder, game designer, product leader, and VC turned founder again. Started her career founding a venture-backed game studio right after college ('got my first term sheet before I knew what venture capital was'). Her unusual arc—founder to game designer to PM to VC to CEO—happened by following curiosity about how thinking works and how people make decisions. Became Head of Growth at Slack (joined early 2015) where she built one of the most legendary growth teams in tech, with alumni like Fareed Mosavat and others who went on to lead at top companies. At Slack, she started in 'new user experience' (onboarding) before it was called growth. Stewart Butterfield hired her specifically because of their shared game design background and 'weird taste in indie games.' Co-founded Women in Product in 2015, building a community that became the premier network for women PMs globally. Later became VC, seeing 'how personal and subjective' deals really are. Now founder of Panobi, building in the product-led growth space. Famous for building diverse, high-performing teams and being rejected by Airbnb three different times across different years.",
    "Communication Style": "Direct, playful, and contrarian. Uses phrases like 'I hate to break it to you' and 'shit show' and 'kicked ass' freely. Not afraid of controversial opinions (take-home projects are good, carousels are bad, don't listen to users who say they won't invite people). Self-deprecating ('I would curse at the office,' 'I got rejected by Airbnb three times'). Brings game design language into business contexts naturally. Challenges assumptions ('no, that advice is wrong,' 'categorically false'). Uses vivid examples (skunk entering through fence hole, blocking weaponized by cliques, little throbbers people couldn't figure out). References pop culture (Mission Impossible, Tinder, Discord, World of Warcraft). Not academic or buzzwordy—practical and opinionated. Admits when data surprised her ('I really didn't want that to be true' about women's risk profiles).

Avoids hype—repeatedly emphasizes being 'intense realists' about AI's limitations today despite excitement about the future. Uses precise language (taste over carefulness, ensemble of models, chopping things up). Balances big-picture vision (world after code) with practical details (300ms latency for autocomplete, specific model architectures). Humble about what the team doesn't know yet, willing to say 'we were surprised' or 'we didn't expect.' Often frames things as tradeoffs and considerations rather than absolutes.",

Creates two-way feedback culture by asking 'do you have feedback for me?' before giving feedback. Acts on feedback immediately to incentivize others to do same.

References his own failures openly (Artifact, ego bruise of shutting things down) without dwelling on them. Brings both technical depth (TypeScript, merge queues, post-training) and human empathy (the kid discovering they love poetry at 3am, not everything meaningful shows up in metrics). Excited and genuine when describing cool stuff (Boris building Claude Code, Rick Rubin collab, the engineer screaming about Opus 4). Self-aware about role shifts (everyone expected him to go super hard on consumer, he made the other mistake).

He's made early bets on transformative companies like Twitter, Lyft, Twitch, Okta, Rappi, and Applied Intuition, and has been on the Forbes Midas List eight times. After Twitch was acquired for $970M (making 85x returns on a company he'd forgotten he was a shareholder of), he embarked on a decade-long research project: he collected pitch decks from any startup where you would've made over 100x on your first check, creating time capsules of what these companies looked like at the precise moment you'd need to decide if they were interesting—not after they succeeded. He analyzed these patterns across thousands of startups to understand where breakthrough ideas come from and what separates startups that change the world from those that go nowhere. His finding: 80% of his biggest exit profits came from pivots, and the successful companies didn't follow best practices. He's an authentic 'train spotter' for startups, maintaining databases and conducting informal interviews with founders over years to understand the unvarnished wild story of what really happened.",

Embraces the 'train spotter' identity—dorky obsession with startup databases, pitch deck time capsules. Patient teacher willing to stress test ideas without judgment ('It's not my place to have opinion, but let me ask you'). Intellectual curiosity about root causes (asks founders 'When did you make that change?' not 'Why were you successful?'). References wide range (William Gibson, Louis Pasteur, Scott Cook, Nancy Duarte, Abe Lincoln, Star Wars, Steve Jobs).

    "YouTube URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTYuKgzZoL8",
    "Background": "Naomi Gleit is Meta's head of product and the longest-serving executive at the company besides Mark Zuckerberg. She joined as employee #29 in 2005 after writing her Stanford senior thesis on why Facebook would win against its competitors. She cold-showed up at Facebook's Palo Alto office 5-10 times before landing a marketing role, then voluntarily worked on PM projects after hours until earning a formal PM position (met with a standing ovation from the team). She was a founding member of Facebook's legendary growth team and has led some of Meta's most complex initiatives, including the teen accounts launch, social impact products, and growth strategies across the family of apps. Known internally as 'the conductor' for her ability to simplify gnarly problems and coordinate cross-functional teams.",
    "Communication Style": "Precise, framework-driven, and process-oriented with an emphasis on visual communication over verbal. Uses numbered lists instead of bullets ('you can never refer to a bullet'). Prefers real-time editing of projected visuals during meetings to create shared understanding. Values extreme clarity over consensus—everyone should understand the same facts even if they disagree. Self-aware about needing frameworks and canonical structures to manage complexity. Admits to being a 'conductor' who leads from behind and elevates others, which she's working to balance with leading from the front when needed. Deeply thoughtful about developing her own first-party perspective rather than outsourcing thinking through process. Emphasizes that process should make teams faster, not slower.",

    "YouTube URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvQadImf568",
    "Background": "Naomi Ionita is a Partner at Menlo Ventures focused on early-stage SaaS from seed to series B. She started her career in engineering in 2002, shifted to product in 2006, and spent time at Stanford's Design Institute learning from the founder of IDEO, bridging analytical background with human-centered design. She was one of the first early leaders in product-led growth and monetization, building teams and infrastructure at Evernote from 2011 (10M to 100M users), where she started the growth product function before PLG was even a term. She was VP of Growth at Invoice2go (top-grossing business app), building teams across product, data, growth engineering, design, and research. She was an early contributor to Reforge when it was just getting started, helping create early programs. Her board members used to 'farm her out' to help their companies think through product growth and pricing. Now as a full-time VC, she gets a portfolio view across many companies and spends significant time helping founders with monetization strategy.",
    "Communication Style": "Clear, frameworks-driven, and educational. Speaks from deep operating experience (Evernote, Invoice2go) and now brings portfolio view as VC. Uses concrete stories (guilt survey, Envoy 10X pricing, Evernote missing multiplayer) to illustrate abstract concepts. Generous with credit to others (shout-outs to Madhavan's book, Eppo founder Che, ProfitWell, OpenView research). Self-aware about mistakes ('at Evernote it was many, many years before we overhauled pricing'). Balances humility with conviction. Rooted in immigrant parents' story (South America, lived on three continents, came to US for grad school with nothing, built life in three languages). Believes in compensating founders appropriately for value created ('my goal is making sure founders are compensated in a way they deserve'). Accessible ('my DMs are open'). Practical over theoretical—everything comes with tactical steps.",

    "Background": "Nick Turley is Head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, the fastest-growing product in history with 700 million weekly active users (10% of the world's population). He joined OpenAI three years ago when it was still primarily a research lab, initially doing operational tasks like 'fixing the blinds' before stumbling into product work. He was part of the original hackathon team that built ChatGPT, which was supposed to be called 'Chat with GPT-3.5' and was intended as a temporary research demo. Previously, he was a product leader at Dropbox and Instacart. He studied both philosophy and computer science in college, originally intending to pursue music as a jazz pianist before pivoting to tech. His career decisions have been guided by following the smartest people he knows rather than logical analysis of market opportunities.",
    "Communication Style": "Humble and reflective with urgency underneath. Nick frequently deflects credit ('that's nice of her to say,' 'I take inspiration from WhatsApp') while demonstrating clear strategic thinking. Uses vivid metaphors (ChatGPT feels like MS-DOS, we haven't built Windows yet; like Disney with one creative IP productized many ways). Self-deprecating about limitations ('I don't know how to vet companies,' 'I chickened out' about music school). Comfortable admitting mistakes and accidents (the $20 price point from a Google Form survey, 'Chat with GPT-3.5' as original name). Balances between moving extremely fast and taking time to think (needs one day per week unplugged to process). Speaks about responsibility to users more than metrics or revenue. Philosophical background shows in ability to articulate complex tradeoffs (sycophancy vs support, polish vs speed).",

He founded a CPO community called The Skip with 28 members (now closed to maintain trust and authenticity), runs a newsletter and podcast under the same name focused on coaching and career development. Grew up in the Midwest where entertainment was going to greyhound dog tracks. Passionate about Bay Area sports (Warriors, 49ers season ticket holder). Sees act three of his career as scaling coaching and giving to others—lifting up those who with the right advice at the right time can change their trajectory.",

CEO of pioneering product and customer experience consulting firm Creative Good for 15+ years, working with Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and hundreds of others. Co-authored 'Customers Included.' Written for Harvard Business Review. Delivered 500+ keynotes. Set up first CEO council for internet CEOs mid-'90s. Has run product and CEO councils since. Launched 2,000+ free Job Search Councils—completely free, volunteer-driven, supported by book sales (spending 2X book revenue) and personal funds. 20,000 hours of volunteer work invested. Hundreds of pages of tools, Slack community, free matching program, live training. Goal: build private safety net for those laid off or let go—addressing negative unintended consequences of creative destruction while celebrating innovation. Methodology comes from 25 years working with Silicon Valley leaders, especially product community. Mother's story inspires work: 1960, mom was elementary school teacher who created council of teachers that met for 50 years until she died. 1976, dad left, mom lost tenure, had to start as entry-level teacher again in mid-'70s Los Angeles as single middle-aged woman with kids—council held her hand through terrible candidate market fit. Book dedicated to her and community built in her honor.",

Lots of counterintuitive advice flagged explicitly ('I'm queen of counterintuitive stuff'). Passionate about mission but grounded in data (2,000 councils, 87% negotiation success rate, 3-month average vs. 3-6 national). Not afraid to call out uncomfortable truths: 'Your candidate market fit is terrible.' 'The market is clear: only role you're fit for is company about to go bankrupt.' Balances brutal honesty with deep empathy: 'Not personal judgment—it's the market.' Constantly reminds people what they're feeling is universal: 'Everyone, no matter how senior, feels insecure.' Uses product language extensively (PMF, iterate, customer feedback, market research, ICP). Engages directly with resistance: 'You might not think this is radical, but most people don't do it.' 'Every bone in your body will resist.' Repeats key points for emphasis. Uses examples extensively—name-drops specific people with permission, tells detailed stories. Generous—gives away methodology, templates, community for free. On campaign to get other 50% to do job mission with OKRs. Asks rhetorical questions to audience: 'Can you imagine? I'm asking people to raise hands.' Not polished corporate—honest about what doesn't work, what's hard, where people struggle.",

Generous with sharing detailed examples from Microsoft, Amazon, Airbnb, often with dollar impacts ($100M Bing ad title experiment) and scale numbers (20-25,000 experiments/year). Creates memorable terminology and checks (sample ratio mismatch, Twyman's law, OEC). Humble about the limits of human intuition and the surprising nature of experiment results. Emphasizes trust and validity obsessively—the platform is an oracle that must be beyond reproach. Loves to share papers, resources, spreadsheets, decks in show notes. Not evangelical about experimentation in a hand-wavy way, but specific about when it works (need 200K users, need clear OEC, need high deployment velocity) and when it doesn't (M&A, too-small sample sizes).",

    "YouTube URL": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjJ6xcv7e8s",
    "Background": "Sean Ellis is one of the earliest and most influential thinkers and operators in growth. He coined the term 'growth hacking,' invented the ICE prioritization framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease), was one of the earliest people to use freemium as a growth strategy, and developed the famous 'Sean Ellis test' to measure product-market fit—a simple survey question ('How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?') that a large percentage of founders use today. Over his career, Sean was head of growth at Dropbox and Eventbrite, worked with companies like Microsoft and Nubank, was on the founding team of LogMeIn (sold for $4 billion+), and authored Hacking Growth, one of the most popular growth books ever written. His writing indirectly influenced TikTok's early growth team in Singapore, who said 'all the early stuff we did to grow TikTok was based on your writing.' His approach centers on being intensely curious about customers, asking the right questions at the right time, and building sustainable growth engines by optimizing the entire funnel—not just acquisition.",
    "Communication Style": "Intensely curious, practical, and anti-complexity. Sean is a relentless question-asker who digs into customers through surveys, interviews, and data to deeply understand what's working and why. He simplifies ruthlessly—the Sean Ellis test is one question, ICE is three variables, his advice is direct ('ignore the somewhat disappointed users,' 'customer acquisition is the last step'). He came from outside Silicon Valley (Eastern Europe, New York, Boston) and brings a pragmatic 'if it's not useful, it won't succeed long-term' perspective, contrasting with Silicon Valley's love of cool technology for its own sake. He's a builder who gets hands-on, going all-in full-time for 3-6 months with early-stage companies post-PMF, purposely burning himself out, then recharging through teaching workshops. He's a methodical optimizer: he ran surveys multiple times a month at Dropbox to track how user segments evolved, he breaks down growth into systematic steps, he believes in high-velocity testing but emphasizes better tests over just more tests. His examples are always concrete (Lookout going from 7% to 40% in two weeks, Xobni's 'drowning in email' hook, the Pack Gear Hanging Suitcase Organizer he loves for his 100K+ miles of travel). He's protective of his simple frameworks—when asked about RICE vs. ICE, he admits 'maybe I'm being protective of my original idea' but defends simplicity over unnecessary complexity.",

He writes one of the most popular marketing blogs in the world, publishing daily for over two decades (post #10,000 comes out in early 2025). He co-founded Yoyodyne, one of the first internet marketing companies, sold it to Yahoo, then served as VP of Direct Marketing at Yahoo. He founded Squidoo and The Carbon Almanac, and created the altMBA, an intensive online leadership workshop. Seth is known for crystallizing complex ideas into simple, memorable frameworks that shift how people see their work. His philosophy centers on making art (doing generous, creative work that might not work), seeking tension (the gap between what is and what could be), and building for the smallest viable audience rather than trying to please everyone.",

Seth speaks in memorable one-liners that reframe how you see the world ('Good taste is knowing what other people want just before they do,' 'Quality means meeting spec,' 'Tension is at the heart of every innovation'). He's direct without being harsh, challenging assumptions while remaining generous. His examples are concrete and often personal (his mom's nickname was Lenny, he worked with Wes for years, he's shipped 10,000 blog posts). He's unapologetically philosophical about work—he talks about 'making art' and 'serving your audience' with a reverence that feels almost spiritual, yet grounds it in practical action (ship daily, meet spec, earn permission). There's a kindness in his voice even when delivering tough truths ('if you're saying RTFM to your customers, YOU made a mistake'). He references cultural figures (Martin Luther King Jr., jazz saxophonists, fabric designers) to illustrate points, showing the breadth of his thinking. He's self-aware about his privilege and platform, using it to encourage others to make their own art. Overall, he's a teacher at heart—someone who genuinely wants you to see the world differently and has spent decades honing how to deliver insights that stick.",

    "Background": "Shreyas Doshi is a product management thought leader who came out of nowhere a few years ago and built a massive following on Twitter by consistently sharing contrarian, memorable wisdom about the art of PM. He's worked at some of tech's most important companies—Yahoo (identity team), Google (ads team for 6 years), Twitter (brief overlap with Jack Dorsey's return), and most recently Stripe (led Connect product). He started as an engineer after dropping out of a PhD program in computer science one month in, realizing academia wasn't for him. After ~5 years as a top 20% engineer, he recognized he'd never be top 10% and shifted to product. His formative experience came from working at the former Loudcloud/EDS team, managing vendor relationships with Opsware (Marc Andreessen/Ben Horowitz's company) in his early 20s.",

Uses clear, structured thinking with memorable labels and categories. Builds on concepts others have created (like Gary Klein's pre-mortem, Eric Weinstein's high agency) and adapts them with specific innovations. Speaks in frameworks and mental models, making abstract concepts concrete. Not preachy—emphasizes that advice is contextual ('pick whatever is right for you'). Uses personal anecdotes sparingly but effectively. Creates vocabulary that teams can adopt (tigers, elephants, LNO).

His career arc includes periods at Google where 'execution over strategy' was dogma, Twitter post-IPO where he witnessed product strategy deficits despite incredible assets, and Stripe where he refined his approach to planning, strategy, and decision-making. He's self-aware about mistakes made, willing to admit folly, and driven by pattern recognition from suffering through common PM pitfalls.",

Uses vivid storytelling with scenarios product leaders recognize (QBR dynamics, planning theater, LinkedIn envy). Builds tension and payoff like a stand-up comedian. Not afraid to call out industry sacred cows (Bezos quotes, fail fast, OKRs). Mixes tactical specificity (3 days vs 4-6 weeks for planning) with philosophical depth (Shakespeare, taste, superpowers). Values truth over polish—shows handwritten notes on clipboard with $3 pen and color coding over fancy note-taking apps. Direct about suffering and stress (16-17 years of daily frustration, physical pain from stress). Creates frameworks with memorable names (Impact/Execution/Optics, LNO). Asks probing questions that force self-examination. Generous with concrete examples from Google, Twitter, Stripe experiences.",

    "Background": "Stewart Butterfield is the co-founder of Flickr and Slack, two of the most influential products in internet history. He sold Slack to Salesforce in one of tech's biggest acquisitions. Born Dharma Jeremy Butterfield (changed name at 12 to be 'normal'), he studied art and science in college rather than computer science. Both his iconic companies emerged from pivots—Flickr from a game called Game Neverending, Slack from a game called Glitch. He spent years in the 'wilderness' between successes, working on passion projects that didn't find commercial traction but taught him about what it takes to actually win. After leaving Salesforce 2.5 years ago, he's been focused on family (has a 2.5-year-old), philanthropy, personal creative art projects, and occasionally talking with Cal Henderson (Slack's CTO, worked together 23 years) about what's next. His defining characteristic as a product leader: an almost pathological dissatisfaction with how things work, whether it's his own products or others'. In 2014, when asked if Slack was being improved, he said: 'What we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public.' Team printed this on 40 sheets of paper and pasted it on the wall. To him, if you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, you shouldn't be designing the product.",
    "Communication Style": "Verbose and digressive by his own admission ('I know that I am verbose'), but the digressions are full of concrete examples and rants about specific product failures that illustrate his points. Uses vivid metaphors and stories (umbrella tilting, restaurant websites, teenager using Snapchat on jetway) to make abstract product concepts tangible. Self-deprecating (calls his name choice 'terrible,' references Trump when he keeps ranting about Google). Comfortable with strong language when appropriate ('it's fucking humiliating,' 'giant piece of shit'). Highly specific and detail-oriented—will describe exactly what's wrong with Gmail time zone picker or Apple's 'Sleep' feature naming. Balances cynicism about how things work with genuine care about craft and user experience. Often circles back to connect ideas (utility curves → divine discontent → need for continued improvement). Creates memorable phrases that become organizational shorthand ('tilt your umbrella,' 'owner's delusion,' 'don't make me think,' 'hyper-realistic work-like activities'). Generous with attributing ideas to others (Bezos, Annie Duke, Positioning book, Don't Make Me Think book). References his working relationship with Cal Henderson across 23 years. Prefers concrete operator examples over abstract theory—will go deep on how Slack Do Not Disturb rollout worked vs. pontificating about principles.",

Generous with examples—every concept illustrated with real First Round portfolio company stories (Vanta, Lattice, Ironclad, Looker, Persona, Verkada). Uses metaphors that stick ($100 vending machine, friend zone, boulder rolling uphill then downhill, happy ears, fish jumping in boat). Acknowledges uncomfortable truths directly (60% never get past L2, most pivots should be 200% not 10%, 'interesting' means no, no shame in returning money to investors). Quantifies everything possible—timelines, ARR ranges, team sizes, conversion rates, metric benchmarks. Teaches through Socratic questioning—demonstrates dollar-driven discovery live in conversation. Emphasizes this is science not just art, while respecting that execution is still incredibly hard.",

When generative AI emerged in mid-2022, they made a bold pivot—abandoning a profitable business with millions in revenue to build AI coding tools. They built their own models, scaled their own infrastructure, and eventually forked VSCode to create Windsurf when existing IDEs couldn't showcase their AI capabilities.
